# RESIDE: Rapid Easy Synthesis to Inform Data Extraction

An R package which allows data to be simulation from marginal distributions obtained from Trusted Research Environments (TREs).

# Installation
## CRAN
The latest release of this package can be installed from CRAN:
```
install.packages("RESIDE")
```

Additionally the development version of this package can be installed using `devtools` or `remotes`:

## Devtools
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hehta/RESIDE")
```

## Remotes
```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hehta/RESIDE")
```

# Usage

## Trusted Research Environments (TRE's)
There are two main functions:

### `get_marginal_distributions()`
This function will get the marginal distributions and store them in an R object. See the documentation on [exporting marginal distributions](https://hehta.github.io/RESIDE/articles/exporting_marginal_distributions.html) for further information.

### `export_marginal_distributions()`
This function will export the marginal distributions to csv files. See the documentation on [exporting marginal distributions](https://hehta.github.io/RESIDE/articles/exporting_marginal_distributions.html) for further information.

## End Users
Once you have obtained the marginal distributions from a TRE, you can import them and simulated data using the following functions:

### `import_marginal_distributions()`
This function will import the marginal distributions from the csv files provided by a TRE and store them in an R object. See the documentation on [importing marginal distributions](https://hehta.github.io/RESIDE/articles/importing_marginal_distributions.html) for further information.

### `synthesise_data()`
This function will synthesise data based on the imported marginal distributions. See the documentation on [synthesising data](https://hehta.github.io/RESIDE/articles/synthesising_data.html) for further information.
