# RESIDE: Rapid Easy Synthesis to Inform Data Extraction

An R package which allows data to be simulation from marginal distributions obtained from Trusted Research Environments (TREs).

# Installation
Currently this package can be installed using `devtools` or `remotes`

## Devtools
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hehta/RESIDE")
```

## Remotes
```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hehta/RESIDE")
```

# Usage

## Trusted Research Environments (TRE's)
There are two main functions:

### `get_marginal_distributions()`
This function will get the marginal distributions and store them in an R object.

### `export_marginal_distributions()`
This function will export the marginal distributions to csv files.

## End Users
Once you have obtained the marginal distributions from a TRE, you can import them and simulated data using the following functions:

### `import_marginal_distributions()`
This function will import the marginal distributions from the csv files provided by a TRE and store them in an R object.

### `synthesise_data()`
This function will synthesise data base on the imported marginal distributions.

# Worked Example Using the Internation Stroke Trial
The following is a worked example using the [International Stroke Trial (IST)](https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/104) which has been included as a dataset in the package under ODC-by licence.

```
# Load the package
library(RESIDE)

# Get the marginal distributions
marginals <- get_marginal_distributions(IST)

# Export the marginal distributions
export_marginal_distributions(marginals)

# Import the exported marginal distributions
marginals_imported <- import_marginal_distributions()

# Synthesise data from the imported marginal distributions
synthesise_data(marginals_imported)
```
